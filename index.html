  <h1>Marc's Art</h1>

  <b>I want a grid of all thumbnails like instagram, where each one is a link that I can click to bring up a larger image on the left with a text description on the right and an x that can close it. </b>
  <b>I want there to be an upload image button that lets me upload an image plus enter a descripton which then automatically gets added to the image list</b>
  <b>if possible, make it only load the larger image when it is clicked rather than on page load</b>
